JavaAlgebraicDataTypesSample
============================

I wanted something like Haskell's Algebraic Data Type in my daily Java programming.
http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Algebraic_data_type

After a bit of Googling and hacking, I found it wasn't that hard to do.
Unfortunatly it requires a bit more code then in Haskell.  Oh well..

Anyways, take a look at the test to see how you'd use it.
